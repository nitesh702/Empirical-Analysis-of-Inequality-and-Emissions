The results exhibit a trade-odff between income inequality and emissions. It implies the relationship needs to be further probed and contexulaized. 


Further Quastions:
1. How does the impact of income inequality on greenhouse gas emissions change with the growth rate, income level and political regime of a particular country or geo-political entity? 
2. Does the nuances of the relationship across categories of countries imply different, and often contradictory, policy recommendations?
